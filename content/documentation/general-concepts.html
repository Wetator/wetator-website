<p>
    For working with Wetator you just need to know the {{% pagelink "test-case-and-command" "structure of the test cases" %}} and the two concepts for addressing parts of your web application:
    <ul>
        <li>The {{% pagelink "content-pattern" "Content Pattern" %}} – for asserting content
        <li>The {{% pagelink "wpath" "WPath" %}} – for addressing a distinct web page element
    </ul>
