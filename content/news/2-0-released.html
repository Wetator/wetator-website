<p>Wetator 2.0.0 is available.<br/>
Version 2.0.0 bring a complete control finder implementation to support modern web applications. The control detection is no longer based
on the (form) control type (e.g. buttons are clickable). The new control finder uses the capabilities of the html tags - e.g. tags having an onclick
handler assigned are now also detected as clickable.
This release uses the HtmlUnit 2.58.0 release. Please have a careful look at the <a href='/download/release-notes'>release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy smart testing...</p>
