<p>
    For working with Wetator you just need to know the <a href="/wetator-documentation/general-concepts/test-case-and-command">structure of the test cases</a> and the two concepts for addressing parts of your web application:
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/documentation/general-concepts/content-pattern">Content Pattern</a> – for asserting content
        <li>The <a href="/documentation/general-concepts/wpath">WPath</a> – for addressing a distinct web page element
    </ul>
