<div class="docu">

<p>Wetator test cases are stored in test case files as a table where every line contains a command.<p>
<p>
There a three different file formats supported for writing down your test cases out of the box:
<ul>
  <li>Wetator XML (*.wet)</li>
  <li>WikiText (*.wett)</li>
  <li>Excel (*.xls, xlsx)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The details of these formats, as well as the main benefits and problems with them, are explained on the subsequent pages. Which format to use depends on your context.</p>
<p>Please find sample files using the different formats inside the 'templates' folder of the distributed zip file.</p>
