<div class="docu">
  {{% cmd-register-cs-hint %}}
  <p>Deselects an entry from a list.<br>
    Use this to deselect options from a single or multiple select list, a group of radio buttons or deselect a checkbox.
  </p>
  <div class="hint">
    Keep in mind, that radio groups are not deselectable. So this command doesn't search for radio buttons. 
  </div>
  
  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  <div class="params">
    <div class="param">
    <div class="name">wpath</div>

      <dl>
        <dt>Single Select Box</dt>
        <dd>The path is usually the label of the select box, a {{% wpath-separator %}} and then the text of the option to deselect.</dd>

        <dt>Multiple Select Box</dt>
        <dd>To make more than one selection in a multiple select box, use more than one Deselect call.</dd>

        <dt>Check Box</dt>
        <dd>Use the text usually placed after the checkbox you like to deselect. If this text is not unique you can as always define some words before to make the path unique.</dd>
      </dl>
      It is possible to use the '*' and the '?' character als wildcards; '*' matches zero or many characters; '?' matches one single character.<br>
      It is also possible to define a {{% wpath-separator %}} separated list of words (with '*' and '?' if needed). Then this command deselects the first element after all these words.
