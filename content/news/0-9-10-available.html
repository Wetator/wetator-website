<h2>Wetator version 0.9.10 is available.</h2>
<p>This release includes many bug fixes (mainly in HtmlUnit) and some great improvements for Wetator itself. We improved the internal wait implementation for ajax requests, the html report now includes a page snapshot preview and the setting of control values now handles automatic focus changes correctly.<br/>
Again we use the latest HtmlUnit snapshot which brings a newer Javascript implementation, an improved css parser (including CSS3 selector support) and 
many bug fixes.<br/>
Starting with this release the ant task is packed into a separate jar file.<br/>

<p>Happy testing...</p>
