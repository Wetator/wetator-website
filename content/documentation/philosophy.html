As you might already know - Wetator wants to test the GUI of your web application.<br/>
Since this is a somewhat generic statement we want to point out what appears to us when talking about "testing a GUI" and "testing a web application":<br/><br/>

Wetator focuses on assuring the web GUI's functionality.<br/>
This means it is not (or not first and foremost) focusing on content (e.g. particular search results), layout, or functionality of lower layers of your application.<br/><br/>

Assume your application, providing search&retrieval for certain data in your database, has the following architecture:
<br/><br/>
{{% image src="example-application.png" alt="user-gui-service-dao-db" %}}
<br/><br/>
What actually happens when the user wants to search for something is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the user opens the GUI's search page</li>
<li>the user sets some search criteria in the provided input field</li>
<li>the user clicks on the search button</li>
<li>the GUI asks the service to perform a search</li>
<li>the service uses a DAO to access the correct data in the DB</li>
<li>the DAO provides the service with the search result items</li>
<li>the service adapts the search result and gives it back to the GUI</li>
<li>the GUI displays the result</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this scenario Wetator would not test
</p>
<ul>
<li>if the search itself performs correctly (e.g. if the correct result is found according to different search inputs)</li>
<li>if the service contract is correct (e.g. if an exception is thrown for an invalid search input)</li>
<li>if the SQLs are correctly generated in the DAO (e.g. if the correct tables are joined)</li>
<li>if the constraints and triggers in the DB are correct</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>
But what a Wetator test case could cover is
</p>
<ul>
<li>if the search input is used for searching</li>
<li>if the button executes a search</li>
<li>if you cannot excecute an empty search</li>
<li>if the redirection to the result page works</li>
<li>if all information items of the result are displayed properly</li>
<li>if the validation on the search page works correctly</li>
<li>if error messages are displayed correctly when the search goes wrong</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>
To sum it up, Wetator wants to test GUI functionality. Besides Wetator serves as an integration test tool, while the web applications under test are approached via the most outlying layer â€“ the GUI.<br/>
That the service and lower layers are working as required, should be assured in detail and autonomously, using other testing approaches and technologies.
