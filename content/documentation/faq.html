<div class="togglePanel_content">
  <p>Wetator handles file upload controls like ordinary input controls. You can simply use the <et:pages:pagelink id='34' hash='file_upload'>set command</et:pages:pagelink> with the file name (relative to the location of the test source file) as second parameter value.
