<h2>Jenkins Plugin 0.1 available.</h2>
<p>
After a rather long testing phase the new Wetator Jenkins Plugin is available in version 0.1.<br>
It creates reports for your Wetator tests in Jenkins comparable to the JUnit plugin. Additionally it affects the build stability and weather depending on the test outcomes.
