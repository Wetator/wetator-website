<p>You have manged the installation so let us write our first real test case.</p>
<p>For this mini tutorial we use a simple web form from <a href='http://www.wetator.org/testform'>http://www.wetator.org/testform</a>.</p>

<p>Wetator supports three different file formats for storing of test definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>wett - a simple text file with a wiki/markdown like notation</li>
<li>wet - xml based test definiton</li>
<li>xls - use Excel to define/edit your test cases</li>
</ul>
<p>For this tutorial we will use Excel.</p>

<h4 class="togglePanel">Before We Start</h4>
<div class="togglePanel_content">
<ul>
  <li>Create a new folder e.g. 'first-steps'
  <li>Copy the file 'wetator.config' from directory 'templates' to the root of your new test directory.<br>
  This file defines Wetator's setup. There is no need to change everything for the moment.
  <li>Copy the file empty.xls from directory 'templates' also to the root of your test directory.<br>
  Rename the file into 'first-test.xls'.
  <li>Start Excel and open 'first-test.xls'.
  <li>Type wetator -p first-steps\wetator.config &#91;Enter&#93;
  <li>A small popup window appears. Please choose the file 'first-test.xls' and click on open.
  <li>Wetator executes all commands form the selected file. A small progress report is written to the console.
  <li>If everything works fine you will end with some output like
<pre>Tests run: 0,  Failures: 0,  Errors: 0
</pre>
  <li>Wetator writes a detailed protocol for every test run. You can find this protocol in the
  folder 'logs'. Open the file 'run_report.xsl.html' with your browser.
</ul>
<p>So far we have anything ready to write our first test. We have an (empty) excel test definition file, a configuration and the result report visible in the browser.
Your screen might look like this.</p>

</div>


<h4 class="togglePanel">Step 1 - Open the Page</h4>
<div class="togglePanel_content">
  <p>Now it is time to add our first test step - our test starts by opening the webpage 'http://www.wetator.org/testform'.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step1-openurl"/>
  <ul>
    <li>for the command use <et:pages:pagelink id='30' target='blank'>Open Url</et:pages:pagelink> (if you like, you can choose from the list of supported commands)
    <li>the url is the first (and only) parameter you have to provide
    <li>save the file
    <li>Switch to the command window and run wetator again (Type wetator -p first-steps\wetator.config &#91;Enter&#93;)
    <li>A small popup window appears. Please choose the file 'first-test.xls' and click on open (Wetator remembers the directory/file selected during the last run)
    <li>If everything works fine you will end with some output like
<pre>Tests run: 1,  Failures: 0,  Errors: 0
</pre>
    <li>refresh you browser content to see the current result output
  </ul>

  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step1-openurl-report"/>
  <p>The report shows many info about your test</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The overview: you can see the number of executed test, the number of successful/failed test and more
    <li>A graphical overview of the success rate; you can click on the icon tho get some more details
    <li>Click on the icons to show/hide the configuration details used for this test run
    <li>This part present an overview of every single test case executed
    <li>And finally all the details of every single test case
  </ol>

  <p>The report also contains snapshots of all the retrieved web pages. You can either hover the snapshot icon with the mouse or click on the icon to see a lager snapshot in a separate window.</p>

<h4 class="togglePanel">Step 2 - Check That We See the Right Content</h4>
<div class="togglePanel_content">
  <p>It is good practice to prove to get the correct page as result of opening an url. Wetator has two commands for this kind of checks: 
<et:pages:pagelink id='29' target='blank'>assert-title</et:pages:pagelink> and <et:pages:pagelink id='28' target='blank'>assert-content</et:pages:pagelink>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>please add the command 'Assert Title' with parameter 'WETATOR / Test Form'. (Title comparison is done case sensitive)
    <li>please add the command 'Assert Title' with parameter 'The form below is only for testing purpose'
    <li>Rerun your test and refresh the browser window.
  </ul>
  <p>If everything is correct you should get something like this</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step2-assert"/>
</div>


<h4 class="togglePanel">Step 3 - Fill the Form</h4>
<div class="togglePanel_content">
  <p>Now we start doing some real stuff; at first we fill the form.<br/>
  The used Wetator commands are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><et:pages:pagelink id='34' target='blank'>set</et:pages:pagelink> used for entry fields and file upload and
    <li><et:pages:pagelink id='35' target='blank'>select</et:pages:pagelink> for list boxes, radio buttons and check boxes.
  </ul>
  <p>For filling the 'Project name' field we simply add the command</p>
  <p>The 'set' command requires two parameters, the first one points to the entry field and the second is the new value.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step3-set-project"/>
  <p>When running the test your report will offer two different screenshots for this command. This is because the set command (and many others)
  is modifying your application. Wetator takes a screenshot before executing the command and one of the resulting page.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step3-set-project-report"/>
  <p>Additionally Wetator will highlight the input control being the target of the action.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step3-set-project-report-highlight"/>
  <p>Filling the whole form is simple.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step3-fill-form"/>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step3-fill-form-result"/>
  <p>Because of technical restrictions it is not possible to show the correct value for the file upload control.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="togglePanel">Step 4 - Submit the Form and Check the Results</h4>
<div class="togglePanel_content">
  <p>Finally we have to submit the form.<br/>
  The command to use is simply <et:pages:pagelink id='32' target='blank'>click-on</et:pages:pagelink></p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step4-submit"/>
  <p>And for checking the result we can use again <et:pages:pagelink id='28' target='blank'>assert-content</et:pages:pagelink></p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step4-submit-assert"/>
  <p>That is more or less all.</p>
  <et:image name="docu-first-test-step4-submit-assert-report"/>
  <p>Congratulations, you have written your first Wetator test.</p>
