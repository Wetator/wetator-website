<h2>Download &amp; Installation</h2>

  <p>The ant task requires a different Wetator distribution.
  <ul>
    <li>Download the latest {{% pagelink "download" "stable version" %}}.
    <li>Create a new directory (or use the directory from the command line installation)
    and unzip the file into it (preserve subdirectories).
    <li>The file build.xml in the templates directory contains sample ant targets that runs
    the wetator with a collection of files. You only have to adjust the paths.
  </ul>
