    Wetator's commands are delivered in command sets. Each command set is described in its own XSD, which matches the generic <a href="https://www.wetator.org/xsd/test-case-1.0.0.xsd" target="_blank">test-case-1.0.0.xsd</a>.<br/>
    All XSDs offered by Wetator are available online under https://www.wetator.org/xsd/.<br/>
