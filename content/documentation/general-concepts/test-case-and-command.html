<p>
  A Wetator test case is a script of steps, so-called ‘<a href="/documentation/reference/commands">commands</a>’.<br/>
  A command may be a user action (e.g. click on button, set input in field) or an assertion.<br/>
  <br/>
  A Wetator test case is the equivalent to a JUnit test method. For maintenance reasons we recommend to structure test cases by functionality and to keep them small.<br/>
  <br/>
  Wetator test cases are usually defined in *.wet files containing XML. See <a href="/documentation/test-case-files">here</a> for more on the out of the box supported test case file formats</a>.
