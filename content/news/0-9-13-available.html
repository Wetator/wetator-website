<h2>Wetator version 0.9.13 is available.</h2>
<p>This release is the next big milestone on our way to version 1.0. <strong>We have changed the WPath syntax. Now the '&gt;' sign is the default separator instead of ','.</strong><br/>
Of course you can change this by configuration to let your existing test run without change.<br/>
Also included are some bugfixes and improvements (including the usual HtmlUnit update).<br/>
Please have a careful look at the <a href='/download/release-notes'>release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy testing...</p>
