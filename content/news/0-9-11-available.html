<h2>Wetator version 0.9.11 is available.</h2>
<p>This release improves the handling of zip'ed and 'unsupported' content. Wetator now automatically unpacks zip'ed content; you can use assert-content transparently.
For 'unknown' content Wetator handles the bytes as plain ascii.<br/>
We fixed some bugs with the preview in the report. Now it works with Chrome and IE also.
The file chooser got some improvements; he remembers the last selection, window position and size.<br/>
Of course we use the latest HtmlUnit snapshot which brings an updated Javascript implementation (rhino), an improved css parser and many bug fixes in HtmlUnit itself.<br/>
As always please have a look at the <a href='/download/release-notes'>release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy testing...</p>
