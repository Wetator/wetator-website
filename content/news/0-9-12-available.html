<h2>Wetator version 0.9.12 is available.</h2>
<p>This is mainly an bugfix release for the wetator-ant task (the 0.9.11 release of the ant task distribution contains an outdated wetator.jar)<br/>
But of course we also deliver some bugfixes and improvements with this new version (including the usual HtmlUnit update).<br/>
Please have a careful look at the <a href='/download/release-notes'>release notes</a>, there is one change/fix that might make some of your tests red.</p>

<p>Enjoy testing...</p>
