<div class="docu">

  <p>Prepares the processing of the next confirmation dialog.<br/>
  If your application makes usage of confirmation dialogs (javascript: res=window.confirm(question);), by default WETATOR will close those by clicking the 'OK' button.<br/>
Use this command to assert the expected description or to click the 'Cancel' button instead.</p>

  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  <div class="params">
    <div class="param">
      <div class="name">button</div>
      <div class="desc">The button to click; only 'OK' and 'Cancel' are allowed here.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="param">
      <div class="name">message</div>
      <div class="desc">The text to match against the confirmation dialog.<br>
      If the confirmation text of the next dialog does not match, the command that started the dialog (usually a clock-on) will fail.
      It is possible to use the '*' and the '?' character as wildcards; '*' matches zero or many characters; '?' matches one single character.<br>
      It is also possible to define a comma separated list of words (with '*' and '?' if needed). Then this command checks, that the words in the defined order are parts of the page title.<br>
      If your assertion contains a comma, star, or question mark, precede it with a backslash.
